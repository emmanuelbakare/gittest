Whispers of the Wind

The wind whispers secrets through the trees,
A melody soft, carried on the breeze.
Of stars that watch, in silence, up high.

The night embraces the world with grace,
While shadows dance in a gentle embrace.
And in the quiet, dreams take flight,
Guided by whispers through the night.
