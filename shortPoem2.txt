Grace Unending

Beneath the cross, where mercy flows,
A love so deep, it overflows.
The Saviorâ€™s hands, pierced for our sin,
Opened wide to welcome in.

Through trials, storms, and darkest night,
His grace remains, a guiding light.
For every burden, every fear,
He whispers softly, "I am near."

No chain too strong, no heart too cold,
His love can break, His truth unfold.
In Him, we find our peace, our rest,
Redeemed, restored, forever blessed.
