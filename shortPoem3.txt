Victory at Calvary

On Calvary's hill, the battle won,
As darkness trembled, God's will was done.
The sinless Lamb, for us, He died,
Love poured out, arms open wide.

The cross, once shame, now shines with grace,
Where death was crushed, and sin erased.
The empty tomb, the stone rolled away,
Proclaims His victory, bright as day.

In Christ alone, our hope, our song,
The King of Kings, forever strong.
For by His blood, we've been set free,
Eternal life, His victory.
